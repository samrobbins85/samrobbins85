### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam, a Second (going into Third) year Computer Science student at Durham University, UK. 

### What I'm working on
During the week I'm an internship student with [GCA](https://www.globalcyberalliance.org/). I'm working on a range of projects for them, currently building a tool to compare DNS services, you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/samrobbins85/dns-comparison).

In my spare time I'm building a notes website to replace my [LaTeX notes](https://github.com/samrobbins85/university-notes), you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/samrobbins85/notes-site)

### What I'm currently learning
In the process of creating both of these projects I am learning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), along with brushing up my knowledge on [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### How to reach me
Raise an issue in the appropriate repo if you notice something that needs changing. If you want to contact me for something else, then you can find all my contact details on my website [here](https://samrobbins.uk)
